Step 1: Implement a failing test for the customer search functionality. Create a new test file 'CustomerSearch.test.js' in the appropriate test directory. Write a test that expects a search function to return results when given a lastName, partyId, or dateOfBirth. Ensure the test fails initially, as the implementation doesn't exist yet.

Step 2: Develop the customer search component. Create a new file 'CustomerSearch.js' within the frontend directory. Implement a React component that renders a search form with input fields for lastName, partyId, and dateOfBirth. Use the Temenos color palette (#5CB8B2, #8246AF, #283275) for styling, ensuring WCAG 2.1 (AA) compliance for color contrast. Add event handlers for form submission, but leave the actual search functionality empty for now.

Step 3: Implement the search functionality. In 'CustomerSearch.js', add a function to handle the search logic. Use the existing temenosApiService to make API calls to the backend, mirroring the mobile app's approach. Ensure error handling is in place, providing clear, friendly error messages in line with the Temenos voice guidelines. Update the test in 'CustomerSearch.test.js' to check if the search function correctly interacts with the API and returns results.

Step 4: Create a customer list component. Develop a new 'CustomerList.js' component to display search results when multiple customers are found. Style it consistently with the Temenos color template and ensure it's responsive across different screen sizes. Implement keyboard navigation and proper ARIA roles for accessibility. Add a new test in 'CustomerList.test.js' to verify the component correctly renders a list of customers.

Step 5: Develop the customer details component. Create 'CustomerDetails.js' to display selected customer information, accounts, and loans. Use the existing accountsService and loansService to fetch data, maintaining the same structure as the mobile app. Ensure the layout is visually appealing and adheres to Gestalt principles for improved usability. Implement error tolerance mechanisms, such as retry options for failed data fetches. Write tests in 'CustomerDetails.test.js' to verify correct data display and error handling.

Step 6: Integrate the new components into the main application. Modify 'app.js' to include the new CustomerSearch, CustomerList, and CustomerDetails components. Implement the navigation flow between these components, ensuring a smooth user experience. Use subtle animations for transitions, being mindful of performance. Add integration tests in 'app.test.js' to verify the correct flow and interaction between components.

Step 7: Conduct comprehensive testing and refinement. Run all unit and integration tests to ensure full functionality. Perform manual testing across different devices and screen sizes to verify responsiveness. Conduct accessibility audits using tools like axe-core to meet WCAG 2.1 (AA) standards. Refine the UI based on Temenos voice guidelines and visual perception principles. Update documentation to reflect the new Branch application functionality and any changes in component interactions.
